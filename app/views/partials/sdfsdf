        <h3>Gourmet Bison Burger With Bacon</h3>
        <p>The Bison Burger features a perfectly cooked beef patty, gooey melted cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickled onions, ketchup, smokey P&B housemade mayo, and a brioche bun. Don't forget to throw on some tasty bacon to add that last bit of flavor heaven. The Bison Burger is a melt in your mouth juicy, cheesy, salty, and tender masterpiece. The pillowy bun seems to melt with each bite and the ratio of the ingredients creates a perfect texture where none of them overpower the burger, while all of them contribute to the flavor profile. The ingredients are well thought out, portioned appropriately, and are high quality. </p>
